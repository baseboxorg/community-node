Well, it's been quite a journey. Maybe it's time for a recap.

I started this project as soon as I heard about the java-tron project. It wasn't long, though, before I learned that a real Super Representative wasn't just one guy with a server, it's a whole organization. Even though I was relatively new to crypto and was still trying to earn 200 karma points to post on Reddit, I thought maybe I could bring people together from twitter, reddit, youtube and other Tronix forums to create a Super Representative group.

Turns out I wasn't the only one with that idea, and while I may have beaten some of them to my announcement, they already had large organization. Undeterred, I pressed on.
