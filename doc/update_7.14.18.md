Well, it's been quite a journey. Maybe it's time for a recap.

I started running a node as soon as I heard about the java-tron project. It wasn't long, though, before I learned that a real Super Representative wasn't just one guy with a server, it's a whole organization. Even though I was relatively new to crypto and was still trying to earn 200 karma points to post on Reddit, I thought maybe I could bring people together from twitter, reddit, youtube and other Tronix forums to create a Super Representative group.

Turns out I wasn't the only one with that idea, and while I may have beaten some of them to my announcement, they already had large organizations built. Undeterred, I pressed on.

The first thing I did was I published a Witness Node how to for newbies. And the first thing one of the other candidate groups did was plagiarize it and redistribute it. So the first thing I learned was that the various Super Representative groups were all operating at different levels of professionalism.

During test net, I spent all my days in the 'issues' forum at the github java-tron repository. I discovered a lot of bugs, but what I discovered in the end was a few of these weren't really bugs. Like the time I would sync to a different block height, I think they were testing the potential for a 51% attack. I chalk up most of the "hiccups" to these tests. 

A lot of us reported bugs to Tron, but that doesn't really take any talent, and it probably didn't tell them anything they didn't already know. What was really helpful to Tron was when we went out and found solutions. I found one such solution, and last week I was informed I'd be receiving a Bug Bounty for it!

One of the challenges during the test net phase was to stay productive when the application wasn't working. To me, this was just an opportunity to multitask, putting on the hat of CEO and CFO too. I crafted a rewards plan that is unique, and in my opinion it actually ends up strengthening the trust level of our witness node. 

The CEO role was the hardest, as I've never held a management position. I learned not to force anything, instead letting people come to me and let me use their best strengths. Greg was the first person to join the team, and then Colradi and Duane came on board. The beauty of this was all I had to do was delegate assignments that they were anxious to perform. We didn't need a dictator, we just needed someone to set a steady course.

So maybe we had a community member who was difficult to deal with in the beginning. The easy temptation would have been to kick him out of our group, because I really don't have time for this. But I made time for him. And instead of creating an enemy, I offered him an internship and began to mentor him. That's how you win a campaign, one ally at a time.

I remember the day Tron announced they would require a 100,000 TRX application fee for the Super Representatives. I was crushed. There was no way I could come up with that amount of TRX.  But the Community Node members said not to worry about it, they had my back. In the end, Tron lowered the fee to 9,999 TRX which made me very happy. In the meantime I was just a little bit short for the 15,000 TRX needed for the SR deposit. Out of the blue, a coder extraordinaire named Rovak came to the rescue, and he gave me 2448 TRX to complete the deposit. I think I cried a little when that happened, for I was really getting to see what the Tronix community was all about. Roy didn't join our team that day, he's just an incredibly nice guy who wants to see us all succeed.

Helping everyone succeed is something we at Community Node take to heart. We are the open source Super Representative group, and we've had all of our corporate docs and howtos on github since day one. I don't think you can create a more transparent organization. We've even begun a 'fledgling program' to help people who want to run their own nodes. What? I must be crazy to cultivate the competition, but the way I see it, it just makes us stronger. Every new node we help to get established just makes us that much more of an invaluable community resource.

Going forward, I see our role as becoming a trusted source for information. Even among Super Representatives, there is a lack of consistency in the messaging. One SR group is telling their members they can choose how long to freeze their TRX for voting. That's not how it works. You must freeze for a minimum of 3 days, and after that you can unfreeze at any time. Your TRX will stay frozen until you unfreeze them. And if you vote once, that vote gets repeated every day until you change it.

Theres's still a lot of work to do. My training is as a network engineer, but I've spent some time learning object oriented programming. I'm coding a website that will calculate the voter rewards for us, and then batch send all of those rewards out every day. It's some cutting edge fintech stuff, but I think I can do it.

Well I hope you find this interesting and helpful. I hope to write more updates that give the voters a sense of the soul of our organization.
