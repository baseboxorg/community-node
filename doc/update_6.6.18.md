When I first set out to create a Tron Super Representative organization, I began with a set of core values.

Number one on that list was I wanted to leave my mark on the knowledge base. Everything that I'm learning I wanted to document and share for the benefit of those who come after me. I also wanted to provide a blueprint for someone following my path. I'm happy to report that [the Community Node repository](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node) has been forked 4 times! Anyone can grab a copy of my work, but at least 4 people have used it to start a project that they will customize. Good luck to them!

Number two on my list was I wanted to let my voters contribute to the running of Community Node. Today, there have been some changes, but in a way nothing has changed at all.

Let me start with a story.

Before I really understood what the java-tron application did, I, and other SRs, saw Tron's recommended AWS x1.16x server size and thought the challenge would be to increase the size of that, with the obvious upgrade being an x1.32x or in my case try to build a symmetric multiprocessor cluster that acts as one giant machine. I was having the hardest time engineering an efficient, low latency multithreaded protocol. But that's not the way this works. The java-tron application IS a perfectly engineered, low latency multithreaded protocol that connects an infinite number of node computers. I was reinventing the wheel.

In the beginning I also had the notion of issuing a token for the purpose of letting our supporters lock in their votes for Community Node and receive credit not only for that vote, but for their history of voting. Well I refined that by building a database that searches each voter address and counts the days it has voted. And I really don't *need* to lock in anyone's vote, not now that I know Tron's freezing process will keep everything frozen the way it was the day you set it, until you change it.

And then I wanted to use that token so I could ask my voters questions about how we should run Community Node to accept their input. I was trying to take grassroots management to a new level. But if you think about it, isn't that what the Tron Super Representative elections do? Every day, voters can vote their approval or disapproval of each Super Representative's actions by getting them elected or not. This is not a major betrayal for core supporters to not vote for their favorite Super Representative one day, it's not the end of the world. If an SR can't handle a day off the list then they should rethink their business plan.

And lastly I wanted to build something that would last. Part of that idea was creating a public foundation to run the Community Node Organization, which would have a board of directors voted in by our token holders the way stock holders run a public company. 

As a Tron Super Representative, our #1 priority is to safeguard the security of TRX transfers. The obvious task there is on the technical team to harden our server deployment.

The not-so-obvious task is to build trust. Trust is the backbone of the DPoS system, because if a Super Representative can not be trusted, if we allow the network to become overtaken by Super Representatives who can not be trusted, then nobody will be able to trust the TRX coin, the Tron20 tokens, or any of the dapps that run on them.

We poked some holes in our technical setup and then hardened the exposed vulnerabilities. Now it's time to put on our executive hats and harden the exposed vulnerabilities in our organizational setup.

Just as there was no need for us to build a giant superserver, or for us to create a token to assist in receiving supporters' feedback, there is no need for us to structure our organization in a way that lets management be replaced by the voters. There's no need to replace me within Community Node because I AM Community Node. It is my leadership which brought the rest of the team together, and with a new leader at the helm, frankly, I don't think they would stick around. If the voters disapprove of my performance as chief executive, that's what the other 99 Super Representative Candidates are for. If you want to do better yourself, have at it! I'll even give you instructions.

I have given this subject considerable thought, and the **only** thing that allowing a Super Representative group to be run by a public entity achieves is it exposes the Super Representative node to a hostile takeover. Here is where idealism must be ditched for pragmatism.

So it's with a little bit of sadness but backed by a lot of confidence that I announce Community Node Organization will not be a publicly held company. I discussed the change with my core team members and they are on board with it. I certainly hope the community doesn't feel like this is a bait and switch, because I don't. I feel like this is the responsible thing to do, and I do have a serious responsibility here. 

Thanks for reading this far, and we'll see you around the Tron main net.
