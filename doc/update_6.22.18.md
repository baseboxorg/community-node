Well, gang, as we come down to the final 48 hours, it feels like it's time to wax nostalgic for a minute...

I have always felt that the Tronics community was a real community of people who care about something in common. There have only been a couple of times in my life when I've experienced that, one time in particular was in 1997, when fans of The Verve had a little sanctuary of super coolness on an email list before popularity set in.

Yeah, that's right. You are my new super-cool friends. All while TRX was taking a beating, you hodled strong. You took their jeers on the chin with a resolution that only comes from a deep certitude, and I admire that. Ye of the not easily swayed variety. And that actually makes this a more special opportunity. Before there was "Bittersweet Symphony" people didn't really *get* The Verve, but some of us felt the magic and it just meant there was that much more magic to share amongst the ones who did. Soon, though, the equivalent of drunk football fans will invade our space. 

Whatever the outcome of the first elections, I have been moved by the support you have shown me - even from those of you whose allegiance to another candidate is unwavering. I want to say that nothing will change if our Community Node gets < 0.1% of the vote or if we get > 3%. We will keep following the long term community support plans we have set out to accomplish. We were built to last. The marathon starts in 48 hours, and yes, some of the runners will simply get into golf carts and get whisked to the finish line, but for the rest of us there is plenty of opportunity. Remember, the company that brews Sam Adams didn't start until 1984, and now they have 7% of the market. There's nothing wrong with getting a slow start.

The Tronics community is committed to the long term soundness of the TRX ecosystem, and so is Community Node. We have become a leader in passing milestones and helping the community. We set out to run a reliable server and we succeeded. Our Witness node has been running since the relaunch of the main net on June 1, and it never missed a single grpc ping. We were the first to win a bug bounty, the first to have a private testnet, the first to put together a dapp development program, and the only one to initiate a mentoring program for people who want to launch their own super representative organizations.  YOU will be the ones to employ us. Our node is your node, our knowledge is your knowledge, our revenue is mostly your revenue, our resources are provided for your benefit.

As we enter a new world like nothing any of us have ever seen before, together we really will be making history. We are proud to join all of our fellow Tronics in ushering the day forward!
