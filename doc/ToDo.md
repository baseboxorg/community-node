Please send to od@tron.network (Title: Video Of *** Team For TRON Super Representative Elections)

I'm Jason Neely from Community Node. We come from Spain, Hong Kong, and the United States and we want to join TRON super representative elections. I will give TRON a hand on TRON’s Independence Day.  

Our team is excited by the idea of economic justice and the decentralization of wealth and power.

We have crafted a Rewards Program which will create a stable daily voter reward even on the days when we are not elected as Super Representative.

But every rewards program must also be sustainable. We have a responsibility to the long term growth of the network. We'll start with a 280 core cluster and our expansion plan will add another cluster of nodes for every .04¢ cent rise in the price of TRX. By the time TRX is at .50¢ we should have the largest deployment footprint of any Super Representative.
