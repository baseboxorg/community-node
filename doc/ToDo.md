Jason Neely, founder of the Community Node organization. I have more than 20 years of IT experience which began with a Cisco certification. Although I'm relatively new to crypto, I have focused nearly all of my attention on the Tron project and I have gained an extensive knowledge of their blockchain application.

In addition to myself, we have colradi, Duane, and Greg, who come from Spain, Hong Kong, and the United States. Colradi is a former Java teacher and he is creating a demonstration application for the community to use as a template for their first dapp. They will then be able to upload their dapp to our testing network to see how it functions, before official production deployment to the Tron main net. Duane is our graphics and UX guy. So far he's made our awesome logo and he's hard at work designing our new website. Greg brings a wealth of IT experience from his job as a SysAdmin for a major aerospace manufacturer. We also have a few more team members who are hiding in the shadows.

Our commitment to the Tron network is long term. We understand this program isn't merely a way for us to generate personal income. In addition to providing the resources that will run the Tron network on day one, we have a responsibility to the long term growth of said network. Our expansion plan will add another cluster of nodes for every .04¢ cent rise in the value of TRX, and by the time TRX is at .50¢ we should have the largest deployment footprint of any Super Representative organization.

We will offer up to 80% of our Super Representative rewards back to the TRX holders who vote for us. We have crafted a unique rewards plan which will offer a consistent reward even on the days when we are not elected. To accomplish this consistent payout, the rewards plan will build up a payout fund of 4 Million TRX, and when the current TronSR program ends in 2021, we will spend that 4 Million TRX fund on infrastructure hardware to position us for the next phase of the Tron development timeline.

-------------------------------------------

We also need the following info before we begin. Can you let us know the following:

1) Who will be taking the interview and what is his/her role in Community Nodes?

2) Can you submit us some photos of the person taking the interview? What we will do is to draw up a comic style version of the person and post it as our Twitter and interview post's featured image. It will be something like https://twitter.com/TronDotLive/status/1002132650088280064  Of course, it is ok if you want to keep it private for now.

3) TronLive website is actually undergoing a whole new makeover and we will have a section for SR. The community will be able to check your details and you will be able to update your profile regularly. Are you interested in having an official TRON SR profile on there?

4) We encourage TRON SR to record a campaign video and have it ready by June 15th. Keep the video short (30 sec - 1 min max) and have  
focused introduction of your team,  
a short phrase explaining why Tronics should join your team,  
and a shoutout of your team slogan at the end.  
After your video is ready, send it to us and don't post it on your official channels yet.  
We will ensure all the videos have a consistent format and review it with TRON Foundation before posting. We will be promoting the campaign video just before the TRONSR election. If you think you will have a campaign video, please let us know in advance.

5) If you have any photos or graphs that you think may be useful for the interview summary which we will have on our site, please submit them to us too.

6) For the video interview, we will be using Skype and the interview will be on June 15-16. The interview will be short and precise so the community can easily learn more about what you have to offer, it should be completed within 10 minutes of time. Let us know your timezone and availability so we can schedule a slot for it. For the textual interview, we can have this completed over email exchanges and we don't need to schedule a time. Let us know your preference.
 
Looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Thank you.
