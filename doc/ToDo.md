TRON LIVE INTERVIEW

can you please provide the following details as well so we can have it up for the community to check on:

Introduction - A brief introduction of your team
Campaign slogan - Team motto or slogan (limited to 60 characters)
Commitment - What the candidate will do to secure TRON network (e.g. long term HODL, frequent update, guaranteed node uptime, etc)
Incentive - What the candidate will offer to its supporters (e.g. profit sharing, live stream with supporters, etc)
More info - Link to official candidate campaign page (if applicable) 

-------------------------------------------

We also need the following info before we begin. Can you let us know the following:

1) Who will be taking the interview and what is his/her role in Community Nodes?

2) Can you submit us some photos of the person taking the interview? What we will do is to draw up a comic style version of the person and post it as our Twitter and interview post's featured image. It will be something like https://twitter.com/TronDotLive/status/1002132650088280064  Of course, it is ok if you want to keep it private for now.

3) TronLive website is actually undergoing a whole new makeover and we will have a section for SR. The community will be able to check your details and you will be able to update your profile regularly. Are you interested in having an official TRON SR profile on there?

4) We encourage TRON SR to record a campaign video and have it ready by June 15th. Keep the video short (30 sec - 1 min max) and have  
focused introduction of your team,  
a short phrase explaining why Tronics should join your team,  
and a shoutout of your team slogan at the end.  
After your video is ready, send it to us and don't post it on your official channels yet.  
We will ensure all the videos have a consistent format and review it with TRON Foundation before posting. We will be promoting the campaign video just before the TRONSR election. If you think you will have a campaign video, please let us know in advance.

5) If you have any photos or graphs that you think may be useful for the interview summary which we will have on our site, please submit them to us too.

6) For the video interview, we will be using Skype and the interview will be on June 15-16. The interview will be short and precise so the community can easily learn more about what you have to offer, it should be completed within 10 minutes of time. Let us know your timezone and availability so we can schedule a slot for it. For the textual interview, we can have this completed over email exchanges and we don't need to schedule a time. Let us know your preference.
 
Looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Thank you.
