Rewards Plan


Our rewards plan depends on how many votes are required to win a Super Representative spot, and whether we get elected as Super Representative node full time or just part time.

All of the other Super Representatives' rewards plans assume that full-time status will be obtained and that every day will provide 1/365th of the Super Representative's annual gross revenue.

We believe this is a naive miscalculation. It would not be forthcoming if the organizers had considered this possibility and decided not to include it in their business plan.

Our business plan is built around the contingency that we may not get elected as SR every day. Once the other SRâ€™s fail to get elected one day, their rewards program will break down and to make up for lost revenue they will have to lower the reward the next time they win, or else lower their promises of community support and become a purely capitalistic enterprise. Instead of gaining momentum, we foresee an exodus of support from these programs when their voters realize there's been a bait and switch.

We want to create a stable, predictable voter payout every day even on days when we lose the Super Representative election. We will do this by putting 80% of everything we earn into the "piggy bank."  And every day we will pay our voters half of what went into the piggy bank, or 2% of what's in the piggy bank, whichever is greater.

In the beginning the daily payout will be a lot bigger on the days when we win. But when the piggy bank is half full the daily payout will be the same whether we win or lose.

Rewards per vote are calculated by taking the total daily payout and dividing by the total number of votes. Eventually we will calculate the daily payout per vote based on the 30 day average of votes, which will allow us to predict the next day's voter payout with narrowing accuracy.

After 100 days we will implement an extra participation reward multiplier.  For every day a voter has cast 5,000 votes for Community Node, they get 1 day's fidelity. The daily reward for each voter will be increased a little bit for every day of fidelity earned. We will also start giving extra credit for voters with 10 million lifetime votes. We have to say, though, that the extra bit that voters get from the participation multiplier comes at the cost of payout to voters with less fidelity. If all voters have the same fidelity, then the payout won't change for anyone. So our best case example of a voter who gets an extra 40% reward after a year would be if he is the only one with any fidelity. If he is one among a hundred voters, and another voter has as much fidelity as he does, then he'd only get an extra 39.6%. 

We think TRX coin holders will come and go, and some will be with us until 2021 and beyond. It's hard to say how much extra a loyal voter will get in the end, but every little bit helps, right?

The daily rewards payout will be disbursed 3 days after the vote has been cast.

To give you an idea of how our rewards system will work, if we win a Super Representative election with 100 million votes:

The Rewards Account (piggy bank) will get about 27,000 TRX deposited into it, making the total payout on day one 13,500 TRX. The voter reward for the first day is .000135 TRX per vote.

If we continue to get elected with 100 Million votes per day, the voter reward will stay the same until the Rewards Account has 666,666 TRX in it and then the daily reward per vote will slowly grow until it reaches 0.00027

Of course, if we get twice as many votes per day, the reward per vote will be half as much.

*Our rewards plan increases the rate of payout for every day a voter casts votes for us. To keep people from taking advantage of that by casting 1 vote per day, we have a daily minimum of 5,000 votes to receive credit for voting that day. However, to make this available to micro investors, we'll also keep a running tally for those voters ho don't get 5k per day. E.g. someone who only owns 500 TRX can vote for ten days and get a 1 day vote credit.
