Rewards Plan

Many of the candidates for the Tron Super Representative election have announced their intention to issue block rewards to the voters who elected them. We also have a rewards program, but we feel it necessary to begin with some words of caution. 

We think rewards are an easy promise to make as a way to get elected. We also think these easy promises are the quickest way to disappoint everyone and lose all support.

Our rewards plan depends on how many votes are required to win a Super Representative spot, and whether we get elected as Super Representative node full time or just part time.

All of the other Super Representatives' rewards plans assume that full-time status will be obtained and that every day will provide 1/365th of the Super Representative's annual gross revenue.

We believe this is a naive miscalculation. It would not be forthcoming if the organizers had considered this possibilty and decided not to include it in their business plan.

Because the reward is what's left over after expenses are met, part time status severely limits the reward. We are afraid that after attaining part time SR status, which is a significant achievement, we would lose our support due to disappointing the voters who had built up unrealistic expectations about quick returns.

Our business plan is built around the contingency that we may not get elected as SR every day, or even for some time. Once the other SR’s fail to get elected one day, their rewards program will break down and to make up for lost revenue they will have to lower the reward the next time they win. Instead of gaining momentum, we foresee a catastrophic exodus of support from these programs who overpromised rewards for votes.

One of our aims is to create stability within the organization and consistency around the rewards payout. To further this aim we will accrue a payout reserve that will let us give a guaranteed, advertised rate of return, recalculated daily with minimal fluctuation.

We can then initiate a program where every vote is rewarded regardless of whether we win the Super Representative election that day. Essentially, we would create a market for buying votes instead of rewarding them.

As our node wins the Super Representative election, 90% of block rewards will be deposited into the Rewards Account. The Daily Reward Pool is 2% of the Rewards Account. The Rewards Account will grow until 50 days payout has been accrued and the daily Reward Pool amount becomes equal to the daily deposit amount.

The daily reward pool is distributed to all votes regardless of whether the node wins the Super Representative election.

Rewards per vote are calculated by taking the total daily payout and dividing by the total number of votes. 

An extra participation reward multiplier, M, is calculated from the number of days they have voted for us, and the lifetime number of votes cast for Community Node. The formula for this is the number of days the account has voted for community node, divided by 2000, plus the natural log of the lifetime votes minus 16 divided by 20, plus 1, squared.

The vote rewards base rate R provides adjustments for overpayments. The previous day's reward pool is measured against the previous day's actual payout and then the base rate is recalculated accordingly.

The daily rewards payout will be disbursed 3 days after the vote has been cast.

After the first 30 days, rewards per vote will be calculated using 30 day averages of votes per day. This will give our supporters a predictable payout for the next day.

N = number of days address has voted for community node  
T = number of votes address has cast for community node over its lifetime  
A = Daily total of all votes for Community Node  
P = Daily payout for Community Node Voters  
E = (ln T - 16 / 20)] IFF E > 0 and T =/= 0  
M = [(1 + N/2000) + E] ^2  
V = Votes cast for us today by this address  
R = Base Rate (payout / votes: for the first 30 days, then uses 30 day averages)  
D = Daily reward per voting address: M x V x R  


The M multiplier formula is designed to gradually increase the rate for addresses who have a lifetime history of casting votes and total votes cast. It increases with every day that votes are cast, i.e. after 400 days the yield will be approximately twice the introductory rate.

The E component of the M multiplier increases once the address has exceeded 10,000,000 lifetime votes, and caps out after approximately doubling the rate (that cap is based on 260 billion lifetime votes possible). 

M = [(1 + N/2000) + E] ^2  
E = (ln T - 16 / 20)] IFF E > 0 and T =/= 0

The goal of the rewards plan is to encourage heavy participation early on, and continued participation in the long term. If I were a whale my strategy would be to start off with 10+ million votes in order to get the E component of the formula started on day one, and add 5k votes per day after that to build the M component.

Initially, lifetime vote totals have more weight but that increase dwindles over time. The daily vote participation is back loaded so the longer you've participated, the more rapidly the weight increases.

This strategy should catapult us into the SR spot as quickly as possible, and then maintain voter loyalty for the length of the program. Once we have been elected as an earning super representative, we can begin our rewards distribution at 2% of the Rewards Account per day, during which time we may lose elections, but will continue to reward votes. 

We predict an ebb and flow of votes from one Super Representative candidate, as voters search for the Super Representative who was elected with the fewest votes that day, and who will issue the largest vote reward. 

In fact, it has been noted that keeping all 100 Super Representative candidates rotating through Super Representative status will strengthen the network and provide the maximum amount of storage, and could in fact be a Tron Labs strategy for the network.

We believe this process will only strengthen our position, since voters who have picked other losing candidates won’t be receiving any rewards. Their loyalty to their Super Representative candidate could be overcome when they see Community Node supporters receiving rewards even when our node loses the election.

To give you an idea of how our rewards system will work, if we win the first SR election with 100 million votes:

The Rewards Account will get 90,000 TRX deposited into it. The daily rewards pool will be 1800 TRX. The base rate for the first day is 0.000018 TRX per vote.

On the first day someone votes for us, they start with a Multiplier of 1 because the number of days they have voted for us is zero, which divided by 2000 is zero, added to one is one, and squared is still one.

If we lose the second SR election, the day two payout will be 2% less than day one, and will continue on like that, gettting 2% smaller each day the node loses, until it has dwindled away.

If we win the second SR election with 100 million votes:

The Rewards Account now has 180,000 TRX in it. The daily rewards pool will be 3600 TRX. The base rate for the second day is 0.000036 TRX per vote.

On the second day, everyone who cast at least 5,000 votes the previous day will have a lifetime vote total T = 1. Their Multiplier M will be:

E = 0 (because ln T - 16 is negative)  
M = (1/2000 + 1) ^2  
M = 1.001  

They will receive 1.001 x 0.000036000 = 0.000036036 TRX per vote

Since they are receiving more than the base rate, on the third day we have to compensate by adjusting the base rate. We do this by dividing the intended amount for payout for day 2 by the total payout, and multiplying that fraction times the base rate.





If the node wins the SR election for each of those 50 days, the Rewards Account will be fully funded and the Daily Rewards Pool will be 90,000 TRX. If the average daily votes is 100 million like it was on the first couple days, the base rate will be 0.0009 per TRX (*not adjusted base rate).

Putting all this information together we get the case of someone who has cast 200 million votes in 50 elections. They will have a multiplier M: 

M = 1 + 50/2000 + [(ln 200,000,000 - 16) / 20] = 1 + 0.025 + 0.1556913962256 
M = 1.18

and their rewards per vote:

1.18 x 0.0009 = 0.001062 TRX  

which is 38.76%, and 18% more than the introductory rate.
